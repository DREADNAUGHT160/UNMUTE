# UNMUTE
"This is my final year project for my bachelor's degree: a device that converts hand signs into audio signals. The program primarily uses MediaPipe for hand structure detection and machine learning to interpret hand signs, assigning them to corresponding words. This project has been challenging, yet rewarding."
User: How can I make my python code run faster?
Assistant: There are several ways to optimize Python code for faster execution:

1. Use built-in functions and libraries as they are optimized for performance.
2. Avoid unnecessary variables and use efficient data structures.
3. Use list comprehensions instead of loops where possible.
4. Use caching for functions with expensive computations.
5. Use numba or cython for numerical computations.
6. Profile your code to identify bottlenecks.

Remember, always measure performance before and after optimization to ensure improvements.
